NOTES:

    * Refer to OpenThread 1.2 Reference Release QSG.pdf for setup guide.
    * Verified that THCI works with Thread 1.2 Test Harness 1.2, without assurance to pass certification regression tests.
    * Two APIs (`mdns_query()` and `mldv2_query()`) are missing for Host Role. Recommend using Host Device from the other vendors during certification.

FEATURES
